# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses

This is a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The player must guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one by one. The game is won if the word is guessed before a stick figure is completed, and lost if the figure is completed first.

To run the game, download the repository and run the hangman.py file using Python 3. You can customize the game by changing the list of words.
